# Awesome OpenClaw Skills

OpenClaw (previously known as Moltbot, originally Clawdbot... identity crisis included, no extra charge) is a locally-running AI assistant that operates directly on your machine. Skills extend its capabilities, allowing it to interact with external services, automate workflows, and perform specialized tasks. This collection helps you discover and install the right skills for your needs.

Skills in this list are sourced from [ClawHub](https://www.clawhub.ai/) (OpenClaw's public skills registry) and categorized for easier discovery.

👋[Say hi on X!](https://x.com/nozmen)

## Installation

### ClawHub CLI

> **Note:** As you probably know, they keep renaming things. This reflects the current official docs. We'll update this when they rename it again.

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install <skill-slug>
```

### Manual Installation

Copy the skill folder to one of these locations:

| Location | Path |
|----------|------|
| Global | `~/.openclaw/skills/` |
| Workspace | `<project>/skills/` |

Priority: Workspace > Local > Bundled

### Alternative

You can also paste the skill's GitHub repository link directly into your assistant's chat and ask it to use it. The assistant will handle the setup automatically in the background.


## Why This List Exists?

OpenClaw's public registry (ClawHub) hosts **13,729 community-built skills** as of February 28, 2026. This awesome list has **5,494 skills**. Here's what we filtered out:

| Filter | Excluded |
|--------|----------|
| Possibly spam — bulk accounts, bot accounts, test/junk | 4,065 |
| Duplicate / Similar name | 1,040 |
| Non-English — descriptions not in English | 604 |
| Crypto / Blockchain / Finance / Trade | 573 |
| Malicious — identified by security audits published by researchers (excluding VirusTotal) | 373 |
| No or inadequate description — version numbers, metadata, under 3 words | 247 |
| ERC / x402 / a2a protocol skills | 38 |
| **Total not taken from OpenClaw's official skill registry** | **6,940** |


## Security Notice

Skills in this list are **curated, not audited**. They may be updated, modified, or replaced by their original maintainers at any time after being added here.

Before installing or using any Agent Skill, review potential security risks and validate the source yourself. OpenClaw has a **VirusTotal partnership** that provides security scanning for skills, visit a skill's page on ClawHub and check the VirusTotal report to see if it's flagged as risky.

**Recommended tools:**

- [Snyk Skill Security Scanner](https://github.com/snyk/agent-scan)
- [Agent Trust Hub](https://ai.gendigital.com/agent-trust-hub)

> Agent skills can include prompt injections, tool poisoning, hidden malware payloads, or unsafe data handling patterns. Always review the source code before installing and use skills at your own discretion.

**Want to add a skill?** This list only includes skills that are **already published** in the `github.com/openclaw/skills` repository. We do not accept links to personal repos, gists, or any other external source. If your skill isn't in the OpenClaw skills repo yet, publish it there first. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

If you believe a skill in this list should be flagged or has a security concern, please [open an issue](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-clawdbot-skills/issues) so we can review it.
